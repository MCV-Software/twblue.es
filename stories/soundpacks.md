You can customise your TWBlue by placing new soundpacks in the sounds folder. The following is a list of packs created by users to enhance the TWBlue experience.

Installing a Soundpack
----------------------

To install a new soundpack you simply have to unzip one of the folders you have downloaded from this page. Locate your TWBlue folder, and look for sounds. Place the folder you have unzipped there, you should already see one folder called default.

To change the soundpack you are using open TWBlue and go to preferences, sound. There you will find the option to change your soundpack.

Submitting a Soundpack
----------------------

If you want to submit a soundpack, please model it on the default soundpack, making sure filenames and extentions are correct. If you would like to submit it to this page for all to download, you can either send an email to <manuel@manuelcortez.net> or tweet [@tw\_blue2](https://twitter.com/tw_blue2) with a link so we can download the pack.

Thank you!
