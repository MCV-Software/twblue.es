## Donate, investing the cost of a soda can!

If you consider that the project has contributed to an easier use of Twitter and that our work is good, donating is one of the ways to collaborate (among the diverse forms of collaboration described on the frequently asked questions). Thanks to your collaboration, we are able to keep focused on the improvement and development of TW Blue, as well as its availability on the same webpage, among other things. Donate, for example, what a soda can would cost to you and support this project. Below you will find the Paypal button in case you wish to make a donation. Thank you!
