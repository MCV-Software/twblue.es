There are several people behind this project who collaborate with what
is within their possibilities in order to make the project grow up, to
maintain its availability on internet, to give users support and
attention, among others. The list of those people who have contributed
in any way to make TW Blue either more scattered, better or easier to
manage is presented as follows.

From TW Blue we wish to thank them all. All collaboration is an
important part in this project and it makes a difference. We also want
to thank all those users that, even though they are not within this list
(as it is difficult to know who they are), test, report bugs, suggest
improvements, recommend the application and spread it, and help in a
greater or lesser extent that this project is still existing and slowly
improving. Thank you!
